# The Flood

"They will grow," Drem said, behind her. She turned from the saplings surrounding the cairn of stones, one planted tree for each of the bodies they had buried. Moine had been visiting them every night at dusk. Two of them, the pines, were for her sons.

They had burned the bodies, and stacked stones upon the spot, not in the unnatural, even-edged pyramids the crows had taught, but in a haphazard, rounded dome, the kind that formed whenever mourners placed rocks in the mount where they would, undirected.

There had been no priests at the funeral fires, no mind-numbing drums or soulless chants. Drem and Wulf's hunters had killed any who would not renounce their privileges or positions. It had been a wild night, flames licking the sky like the tongue of a snake, dancer's moving like the coils, all the raw songs and grief and hate and fear they'd kept suppressed exploding out into the valley. It had been the first night Drem had shared her bed.

The grief and fear and hope and love burned in her still, like the buried embers of the wood and corpses, the walls and roofs of the temple compound they had torn down and fed into the fire. Her sadness and purpose were like the stones stacked on top, or like the raids that had come the month after, flooding the valley, washing away the crow village that had been, cleansing the site with deep, rolling waters. Water and fire, burning and cold, stacked stones and howling air.

Moine threw her arms around his sturdy chest, wetting his neck with her tears. "They will grow," Drem said again. "A ring of trees, and when the stones have settled, and the ground is flat, we'll build a new temple to honor their ghosts and stories, but in the old way. We're not crows anymore. We never will be, again."

She murmured her agreement, but in her mind Drem would always be part crow, and she was glad of it. If he wasn't, if he hadn't been so strong, he wouldn't have been able to carry out their plan. Wulf wouldn't have been able to kill the high priest, which was why she hadn't told him anything of their plot. If she had, if they had acted a day sooner, maybe he and Tashe would still be here. She hoped they were safe, wherever they were.

"You couldn't protect us," she had said to him, the morning he'd taken Tashe and fled. "He can." Wulf must have thought she was talking about the crow, but she hadn't been. She'd meant Drem, who had promised her he would free them.

Drem had told her the about the night in the cave, haltingly, not bragging as most men would have done, stating simply what had happened, although his mind was clouded from the ur-root he had drunk.

They had followed Wulf to the cave, but hadn't pursued him when he escaped. Instead, the Crow had given them the syrupy drug from the painted gourd, to pull them down into the shadow-world, and put the killing stone between Alyoka and him. He'd grabbed it first. The man who, when they were boys, had been his closest friend, when they grew up as Herons in the gentle glade, snarled and circled towards him, around the fire. When Drem was in the right position, he had raised the sharp-edged stone, and swung it down. Alyoka had jumped back, but Drem hadn't meant the blow for him. Instead, the heavy stone followed its arc past his turned hip, behind him, into the face of the Crow.

By the time Alyoka realized what he had done, Drem had finished it, bringing the edge of the rock down on the Crows neck, like he was driving in a stake.

"It's over," he had said to Alyoka. "We don't have to fight. No more sacrifices. The dark-winged god is gone." The other war-priest, though, who was once his friend, had leapt through the fire towards him. Drum had swung the rock upwards, this time, cracking it against the rushing head. Still, Alyoka had come, knocking him against the wall of the cave, the stone falling to the ground. He wrapped his hands around Drem's throat, squeezing, Drem doing the same, like the necks of two jugs tied together with twine. Alyoka took one hand away to try and land a punch, and Drem had fallen, using his weight to drive Alyoka's head against the earth. The jug had broken, leaking red.

"You are hunters," Moine told them, standing on the speaking stone in the pass, looking down on the flood-washed valley on one side, and the scrub-spotted mountain slopes on the other, mounds of earth greater than any humans could ever hope to build. Her voice echoed from the cliffs not yet stained by sun, although the misty air was awash with light. "This season, we are hunting different game. We are hunting crows."

There were murmurs, and uneasy glances. Only Drem, beside her, didn't move. "Yes, it is taboo. But this is the only way we will ever be safe. Drem killed the high priest, and his acolyte. The altar was destroyed, and the temple burned. The dread songs are fading from our ears. Yet, he tells us, this is not enough. Once a place or people has been converted, taken under the dark wings, they are never allowed to go free." Some nodded, leaning on their spears. Others stared at the ground. "According to the dark law, once a leader is killed, another must come and take their place. It is like a force in the sky, drawing evil up, out of the Earth." The hunters looked around them, at the mist rising up from the rocks and dewy grasses, and shivered, or made the sign to warn against evil.

"Drem grew up with the Crow, who, like him, was once Heron, before the dark wings found them. Their camp was taken, and they were forced into priesthood. It is nearby, a glade no more than a month's journey. Drem thinks that the Crow of crows, the root of the bloody song, will be there, with all his inner circle. The only way the valley will be safe, the only way to live through winters without fear, is if we go to this glade, and kill them."

It was a long journey, not without difficulties. One of the hunters mistook a poisonous for an edible berry, and couldn't move for days. Another was bitten by a snake, and his forearm swelled to melon-size, and had to be coaxed down with a poultice of hard-to-find leaves. Another broke his leg while chasing after a deer. A woman, whose partner had been one of the priests Drem had killed, went crazy under a full moon and threw herself off a cliff, claiming she could fly.

They fished, trapped, and hunted, Drem more deadly with his sling than others with their spears, able to knock birds from branches of far-off trees. Still, they were often cold, tired, and hungry, turning squabbling and sullen.

At night they would sing half-remembered songs. One of them, she recognized as Wulf's. "What would you do if you ever saw him again," Drem asked her once, when he caught her rolling a buckskin pouch her old lover had made between her fingers. She looked at him, and held out her hand. "I would ask him about our daughter."

Finally, running his fingers over notches scratched into the trunks of trees, and studying the broken profile of the hills on the horizon, Drem said they were near the glade. It was beautiful, held in the fingers of five streams, shielded from the wind by trees and vines. A circle of standing stones, and gardens, juts, and houses dug into the earth, with living roofs. Figures moving, wrapped in strange, wooly hides, too far away to see clearly.

"They don't look like crow," one of the hunters said. "Trust me," Drem said, his eyes narrowing, "they are."

A light snow started to fall. The group moved farther back into the trees to hide and wait, without leaving tracks. A hunting party returned from the other side of the glade, their laughing voices indistinct. The sky filled with stars, and they saw the glow of a fire. "One of them will be talking, the others listening. That will be the Crow. I'll take him out first with my sling. The rest of you, wait hidden in the trees. When the leader falls, attack. Kill anyone who fights." The hunters dispersed into the shadows. Drem moved closest, Moine close behind.

"Stay here," he told her, taking out his sling and fitting a smooth rock into the pouch, moving to a closer snarl of bushes. One of the figures was standing, silhouetted by the fire, talking while the others were listening.

Drem starting swinging his weapon in slow circles, over his head, as she had seen him do so many times before, presaging the death of his prey. The standing person started to sing. Not like a crow. It was a song and a voice she knew.

"Drem, no!" She called out, and the figure by fire turned. It was Wulf.

The sling above Drem's head continued to spin, whistling circles in the cold air, faster and faster.
