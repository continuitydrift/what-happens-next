# The God

The flame on the branch went out, reduced to an embered crown and curls of smoke, so Wulf took it back to the fire, the after-images of the corpses writhing in his eyes. There was a deeper cold in him now, that the warmth of the burning, sap-seeping branches could do nothing to dispel. Ripping off a loose shred of his elk-hide cloak, he wrapped it tight around the torch and plunged it back into the coals.

There were no plague marks on the bodies. That, alone, was enough to show that the priests had lied, even without the caved-in skulls. How many people in the village knew? Or knew-without-knowing, kept in silent awe of the crow-cult's power?

Back at the bodies, with stronger light, he noticed how they were piled. Not haphazardly, but in a mound. Behind them was a smoothed and surfaced niche, with a crow skull and cast of bones, like the ones the high priest wore around his neck. The back wall had the same scratched and blood-smeared lines of occult significance that marked the temple. An altar of desecration. The bodies should be burned, or buried under stones, not stacked themselves like a sickening cairn covering some other, hidden, beyond-human thing.

Wulf took his son's hand and pulled him from the pile, causing a loose slide of stiffened flesh, a stirring of whatever was underneath. He fought the vomit in his throat, his heartbeat like footsteps crunching through snow. The bird skull looked at him with hungry, hollow eyes. Time went out along with the torch, hours becoming invisible with the foul-smelling space, Wulf's mind gone to some other place as he held the small, cold hand in his.

He heard voices. Indistinguishable, arguing. One was the warrior who had come to his house, breaking the silence like he had smashed the jar. Another was the Crow. There was a third voice, too, snarling and deep. They had followed him from the village, or maybe the skull on the altar had told them he was here.

"Wulf!" the Crow called, as one would call a goat, the sound echoing and rolling through the darkness. He'd left his spear by the fire. Even with it, even if he could surprise them, he'd seen the two warriors wield their clubs in the summer contests, and knew he could not win. He thought of hiding, concealing himself in the mound of bodies, but the thought turned his stomach liquid. Whatever lay under that mound of carnage was worse than death.

He stepped around the bodies, feeling along the wall in the dark. Next to the shelf with the skull, his eyes remembered a deeper cleft. There! It widened, curving up and beyond slippery domes of drip-formed sediment, which he clambered carefully up, silent as prey. He heard the voices again, and footsteps, coming towards him from the mouth of the cave. Not the language he knew, but the one the crows only used among themselves. Wulf crawled onto and along the slimy shelf, banging his forehead, then his knee, then losing his balance and sliding, but away from the chamber with the bodies.

He was in a shallow sludge of slowly flowing water. That was good. He could follow it. The passage widened until he could walk stooped over. Then he smashed his head again, hard enough he saw his pain as dancing, fiery lights. He wasn't afraid, as calm as when he'd almost tumbled off the cliff, as if trapped in that one moment, rolling towards death, a frozen, time-suspending fall. Nor was he lost. In utter darkness, the mountain told him where he was.

The ceiling dropped again, until he was crawling, then wriggling, like one of those minute creatures of the earliest Earth. He might die here, slowly, being swallowed forever by this closing throat of mud. He breathed out until his chest was flat, and squirmed and pushed, like a baby trough a birth canal.

He was free, then he was falling, a rock bruising his ribs, breath impossible as if his lungs were full of clay. Maybe, up ahead, there was a clue of not-quite total black. He crawled towards dripping water. Stars.

Wulf knew, now, where he was. Maybe he'd always known, some sly, hidden part of his dreaming self leading him here, to the forbidden pass that led out of the valley into the wastes and forests where his old tribe had roamed. He could see the faint flickering of the dying fire a good distance up the cliff from the scrub-hidden spring from which he had emerged. The stars were here to guide him, and after the darkness of the grotto, the moonlight seemed as bright as day, and his feet flew soundlessly over the ground like they were wings and the mountain path a stretch of sky. The Crow and his war priests must have tracked him, and seen the fire. He could easily follow their own tracks back to the village now, if the way wasn't already blazing clearly in his mind. He ran, feeling weightless, stopping only to gulp with cupped hands from a pebbled stream.

Pre-dawn birds were singing when he came to the fields and stacks of marker stones, the goats bleating in their pens, no humans yet awake. The temple compound was unguarded. One young man, shirtlessly tending a cooking fire, tried to stop him, but Wulf growled and he backed away. He was covered with mud, he realized, from head to foot, his face streaked with blood and sweat. His wife was awake, but still in bed.

She looked older, her eyes cold. "Did you know?" he asked her.

"Yes," Moine said, looking down, then raising her chin to defy his gaze. "You couldn't protect us. He can."

"He killed our sons." She didn't answer. "Come with me," Wulf said, holding out his hand with the fingers spread wide in the old custom.

In the seconds it took her to answer, he thought of when he had first seen her, feet painted with berries, when they were little more than children. She'd taken him to the pond and kissed him, then jumped in the water. They were from separate clans, he turtle, she frog, and after the festival he thought he would never see her again, but four years later there she was, taller and more beautiful, and she had danced to the flutes and drums, looking at him over her bare shoulder. She'd taken him to her parents' tent, and they had done more than kissed.

Later, over the long years, there had been other leavings and coming back, her jumping into the pond of the world, disappearing, walking away, but always looking back over her shoulder, rising dripping and clean from the water of her mystery. This time, if she didn't take his hand, Wulf knew he would never hold it again.

"No," she finally answered.

He left, and found their daughter, in the trellised lean-to of the long hall with a half-dozen other girls, and shook her gently awake.

"Tashe," he said. She recoiled at first, from the mask of bloody mud, then smiled sleepily, confused.

"What happened?"

"Do you remember the story about the ball of the world, of the monkey who sat in one place?" Tashe nodded.

"This is a bad place. We have to move, again." He held out his hand, this time with the fingers pressed together. "The Crow killed your brothers. I found their bodies in a cave." Her eyes were wide with dreamy terror. She hadn't known. "I'm leaving the village. I won't come back. If you come with me, we will probably wander and die alone. You can stay here. Your mother will keep you safe. If that's what you want, we need to say goodbye."

His daughter stared at him, unmoving.
