# The Stone

Wulf felt the black wings beat against his face. The stone passed close enough that he sensed the wind and whistle of its passing. Then it flew through the fire, and hit the ground, rolling. With its near-perfect roundness it rolled and rolled, through the darkness. Wulf thought it might roll forever. Then it stopped.

In the sweat lodge, the following night, Wulf relived that moment, but as the stone flung from the sling approached, time got slower and slower, as it had on the mountain when he'd gotten lost and almost rolled off the cliff. He turned his head as it passed, the stone hanging in the air in front of his nose, turning. Tiny creatures crawled on its surface. The rock grew furred with trees and furrowed with mountains and blue oceans, under a sliding dance of clouds and shadow.

"Drink," the medicine woman had told him, giving him a clay bowl with tea made from mushrooms they had collected. Six herons flew forever in a painted band across the rim. The unexpected bitterness had made him cough and sputter. "Again," the tribe-mother had said.

Five others were in the sweat lodge with him, naked around a pit of stones that had been heated in the fire. Wulf had carried one of the strange rocks in, using deer antlers to not burn his hands, surprised at its lightness. It came from deep in the earth, a Heron had said, where stone flowed like water, joined with fire, and finally air. Fragrant liquid was poured over the mound of stones, and they hissed and sent serpents of steam up to coil and circle around their heads. His throat was hot, but also cold, like he had swallowed snow.

After the stone had rolled into the dark, figures had emerged from the trees, and those around the fire rose to meet them, grabbing spears or sharpened stones. Wulf, not having a weapon, had grabbed a branch from the fire, running towards the attackers. There were cries of alarm and attack, both sides advancing, then slowing, pairs circling and snarling in feinted attacks and bluffs of strength.

One of the attackers had ran to Wulf, but without a weapon. It was Moine. Wulf held his torch high, so both sides could see who the other were. The sounds had turned to recognition, and relief. Wulf had held out his other hand to Moine, the two of them centered in a circle of light. She had taken it, and Wulf had laughed.

Drem had walked up beside her, his sling lowered, but his eyes filled with fire.

There was a drum, its skin loosened and tone deepened by the heat. The rhythm seemed to change, flying and crawling and walking, the rolling of it filled with voices dancing across tones, soaring and swooping through notes impossibly high and low. One of the voices, he realized, was his. Taken together, the moving sounds caused the chanting song to be round, symmetrical, and smooth.

Wulf was perched on the ball, the song and stone, turning and flying through the dark. The changes in the sounds he heard were from its whistling, rolling passage. He was moving, flying through the air, although he was sitting on the ground, his back straight, perfectly still. One of those strange, wooly-shouldered creatures from the plains turned to face him, a wide nose like a plough to break through snow and sniff out growing things. In its deep brown eye he saw his own reflection, and he was a bird of bone and shadow.

"I thought you were the Crow," Drem said to him in the council circle, his face shadowed by the fire. After the ceremony of sweat and tea, they had washed in the cold water of the stream, and put on fresh vests, his tied with black feathers, and threw thick hides over their shoulders. Wulf felt clean and light, like his bones were hollow.

"I am," Wulf answered, fingering his necklace of bones. He heard Moine, across from him, suck in breath, and Tashe, next to him, sigh. The woman he had loved looked beautiful and strong.

"The Heron has taught me much," he said. "I've learned, and changed. The crow weren't always as we have known them. The killers are an aberration from a much older, wiser clan. The mounds they build can be beautiful, and now I am able to read the scratchings in the mud. They don't mean what we were told. Crows are drawn by death, but aren't meant to bring it themselves, without the asking. We make sense of it, to turn it into song." Wulf could see Drem looking around the circle, trying to read the faces of the hunters and the fishers, to guess how a fight would end if it started now.

"You were right," he said to Moine, "with your fears that a new Crow would rise when the old one is killed. That's why there must always be one who knows the path, with a clan behind them. To stay with those about to rest, and face the eye of the longest night. When crows are feared, instead of loved, they become hungry, and thirst for blood. Death, when unwelcomed, returns a hundredfold. A Crow like the one from the valley must not be allowed to rise. One came this close," Wulf said, holding his hand in front of his nose, at the distance where the stone had passed, where he had felt the wings beating against his face, "but...was stopped."

He still wasn't sure how Drem had missed, if he'd changed his aim at the last second, or if the stone's course had been shifted by the force of the beating wings. He looked around at the faces of the others, the men and women who had gone with him on the long hunts, and listened to the old songs of turtles, frogs, and flowing rivers. Torgun leaning on his spear, rubbing his chin. Those he had traveled with in this past year, following the herds and fish and fires, who had taught him new songs, and others that were very, very old. Some had white feathers knotted into their vests, and others black. Crows and Herons, Continuity and Drift.

"You almost attacked, but didn't. I hold no anger towards you. If the Herons allow it, you are welcome to stay." Moine, he saw, wasn't looking at him, but next to him, at Tashe. Their daughter stood and circled the fire, throwing her arms around her mother's neck.

___

As the snows began to fall, and the last of the harvests were baked into clay balls, half of the tribe prepared to leave. Wulf would stay, this year, with those too old to travel. Tashe, Moine, and Drem would go with the other hunters, and those too young to not be rolling along the plains and valleys.

It was possible, on the longest night, that the false crows would return, to try to take more blood than was their due, to stack mounds higher than was needed for the rites.

"Don't get lost," Wulf said to Tashe, kissing her forehead as they said goodbye. He himself felt no need to go with them. For now, he was happy here, in the glade with the fires and trees and standing stones. Sometimes, the animal in the vision had told him, the only way to change was by staying where you were.
