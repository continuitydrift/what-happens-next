## Tickets

Anyone can read the story, and vote on the suggestions by reacting to them in discord. To make suggestions or qualify for rewards, however, you need to be a ticket holder, similar to being a live audience member at an improv show.

To get your ticket, simply join the discord and make a suggestion. Your username will be added to the pinned list

## Suggestions and Voting

*What Happens Next?* is an experiment in improvisational writing, translating what I love about improv theater to an interactive online reading experience.
