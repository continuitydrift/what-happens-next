# The Cave

![mountain](/images/mountain.jpg)

The face in the mountain shifted against the sunless sky, a mouth in the profile opening, like one of the old men he remembered from his tribe, craggy cheeks and neck jutting from a hoary mane of juniper. He'd always pitied those toothless elders, too frail to hunt, telling rambling stories, exaggerating the promise and prowess of their vanished youth.

The clean smell of laurel and impending rain, and the trembling, tree-mantled slopes, uprooted something deep in memory. This wasn't a direction the villagers often went, shrouded vaguely in taboo, but Wulf started to wonder if it wasn't the pass through which his tribe had traveled, so many seasons gone. He remembered his manhood rites, staying behind for six days and nights, fasting and staring at the sky.

"What if I don't come back?" he'd asked his mother.

"You won't," she answered, laughing when his eyes went wide with terror. "You are a boy. A man will return."

It was a good story, the running after his people, following the clues they'd left for him, braided branches, being bitten by the snake and haunted by the owl. A heroic quest, coming of age and into mystery, trembling against danger, finding the tracks that led him into power, into purpose. Now, though, there was all this time between, those fields of planted squash and corn, those holes and mounded stones. No one told stories about old men, except as a joke, or warning. He was lost, again, but for no rite or reason.

A loose rock pranked his foot, and he tumbled sidways, towards the cliff. His splayed out arms caught at roots and thorns, hip slamming against stone, skidding until his head and shoulder hung over the drop. Wulf's soul split in two, the old man tumbling down into the dark spears of pines, the child left behind, clinging to the rocks. His mind was calm, gleaming with stunned wonder, like a snake that had just shed its skin. Only later, regaining the trail, rubbing his bruised joints, did his heart start throbbing against his ribs, death beating its wings against his face.

He pulled his hide cloak, the scent of his story, around his shoulders. The sky got dark, the air cold, and it started to rain.

Everything was changing. His tribe had stopped, laying down in the dirt, the song going sour. Ends were circling back to beginnings. The child ventured into the unknown enormity of the world, and the old man wandered out into the even more unknowable realms of annihilation and death.

He thought he saw an eye of cave on a cliff above him, hidden by wind-twisted pines. If he was wrong, finding his way back down through the scree in the dark, or staying exposed on the mountain, might both prove lethal dangers. He lost sight of the cave, but guided by instinct, or memory, he found the tree-guarded entrance minutes after the wind picked up in earnest, and started pelting him with hail.

He took the hearth-ember from the hollow sheep's horn, and the bit of thistle fluff and tinder, and coaxed it into flame. The fire, held in the deep noiseless hum of the mountain, burnt through time, and Wulf was a boy, timidly drawing near the circle of his family's warmth and light. He blinked from the smoke, and felt the weight of knowing that out of all those he'd traveled with, who knew the old songs and stories, he was the only one left. The keeper of the lore, carrying the ember from pit to pit, whose eyes and ears kept the farthest watch. Wulf's breath choked him with a sob. He drew in air, held it.

He'd been so desperate to keep the hunters at his fires, to have them listen, that he'd forgotten: it was all real. Fighting against the temple, the empty dogma of the Crows, he had become guilty of the crime of which he accused the priests: intonations without meaning, rites to gather power instead of vision.

Outside, the wind howled, playing the cave like a flute of bone. This smoke-damp hole was the mouth of the mountain, and he was the mouth of the cave. The eye that saw the flaming moon.

He had followed his mother, once, to where she was pulling reeds apart for baskets, singing, the lonely purity of music she had thought unheard echoing in his life, forever. "I wasn't singing to myself," she had told him, when he'd asked her. "I was singing to the forest, the sky, the earth. Don't ever think that humans are the only ones that can hear, or listen."

Wulf gathered some still-dry boughs and put the driest of the branches in the fire, leaving the rest to warm and thaw. He stared into the flame, clearing his mind of everything. Asking the light to give him song.

There was nothing, and then a speck, a mote. It moved. The tiniest of creatures drug themselves across it as it turned. Other motes accreted from the void, and the movement of these minute animals, kept the spin and shape and balance of the sphere. More and more dust fell inward from the dark, and the creatures, nothing more at first than flailing tails and mouths, complexified and grew, along with the world-ball, but always moving, rolling.

It seemed to spin faster to those crawling, then walking, on the surface, but this was only because the mass increased. The rhythm, the turning, stayed the same, but the farther from the center the life forms were, the faster things seemed to go. The paths of these ever-traveling beasts carved ruts of rivers, canyons, oceans, mountains, the sphere inexact, but always balanced, polished and perfected by the migrations and the turn.

Life flew and swam and danced and plants grew under their wings and fins and feet, and the vegetation also traveled, but slowly, over long, unseen spans of time.

Then, one day, a monkey thought, "I'm tired. This is enough," and sat down, refusing to move. From that moment, because of that little bit of settled weight, the world, which was by then an enormous ball, was thrown off kilter, and started to fall apart. A great mound formed where the monkey sat, and on the other side of the globe, a deep declivity. The great arrow of tendency swerved away from life, from pattern, and into death.

Eventually, for as long as it had taken the world to form, all the motes of dust that had gathered together would be shed, flung back out into the void, as things stopped moving, stopped rolling, dissipating until there was only a mote, a speck, then nothing.

Wulf stopped, astonished at the end of the story that he had remembered, yet had never heard before. His nose caught the scent of decay. He took a burning limb of pine, and went farther back into the cave to pee. His foot sent something rolling. With his makeshift torch, he saw a dented ball of wood. He'd carved it for his youngest son, to roll into gopher-holes. Nearby was the toy, a painted war club, he'd used to bat it around the garden.

Further in the cave he found the bodies.

The cold had preserved them over the winter, but now the skin was sloughing off the bones, the seams unstitched by maggots, worried at by rodents and birds. His sons, and all the others he'd been told had died from plague. Their skulls caved in with identical blows, the roundness of them dented, malformed with the stopping of the world.
