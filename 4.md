# Heron and Crow

"Drink," the Crow told them.

The two priests looked at each other, and then at him, and the Crow saw the fire reflected in their eyes. They had wanted to go after Wulf, after they'd seen the back of his hide scurrying down the slope, with the sound of sliding pebbles, when they went to get more wood, but he had told them no.

The god had shown him a way out. He wasn't the danger. Wulf was a hunter, one who left in the winter. The law forbid his being given to the cave. The threats, the ones who must be culled, were those who stayed. Those who looked into the eye of longest night, like Drem and Alyoka, the two before him now, so clearly lusting for his favor, his power. One squat and brooding, the other tall, and cruel.

"He knows," Alyoka said. "He saw the altar."

"He already knew. They all know, even if they don't. That's the point."

Drem drank from the gourd, gagging, shaking his head like a goat, and passed it to Alyoka, who gulped and scowled.

"Again," the Crow commanded. He started scratching lines in the mud with a rock, chanting. They waited.

The Crow, when he was a boy, had been a Heron. His clan drifted along rivers, worshipping the flow of water, the way it held the reflections and colors of all things: the sun and trees, the rounded stones and thirsty dirt. His people sang, and danced, not with careful steps and ritual prescription, but as water splashing against sound and sky. They'd had no knowledge of or need for fire, eating fish raw and running from the cold.

Then they'd found the hidden glade, held perfectly in the fingers of six streams, with its circle of standing stones, and the trees with nuts as sweet as honey, bushes heavy with berries and hardly any thorns, vines like woven shields against the wind. They had stayed longer each year, gone less far in their migrations, spiraling in, slowly, towards the place they began to think of as their home. They remembered the rivers, but no longer carved canoes from fallen trees, the streams too shallow to float them. Their dances and songs were heavier, more rooted.

The Herons met other clans, and invited them to stay. The Falcons showed them how to use fire, put food into globes of baked clay, which could be broken open months later, the fruit or meat inside unspoiled. They learned about fire, how to call it and trap it in ovens dug into the earth, to make leaves edible that had turned their stomachs before. Wisdom gathered in the glade, making life easy, until some of the Herons had grown older than any in the songs.

So old, that one year, they would not be able to travel, however slowly, to follow the streams down to warmer lands, closer to the blue, salt-smelling borders of the world. "We could stay," some of the tribe suggested. Others balked. It was taboo, against the unspoken way. Water flowed, birds flew. The old who could not walk were left alone, to die. Stagnant pools became unsafe to drink.

Half the tribe left, and half remained, to brave the coming cold. The Crow-who-was-not-yet-crow, still too young for manhood rites, stayed with his family in the glade.

The crows came on the shortest day, the most bitter frost, when everyone was hungry, all the clever balls of clay already broken open, traps set for squirrels and rabbits in the snow. "Welcome," the oldest grandmother said, her hand extended. "We are Heron." The man in front of her wore a necklace of bones. He swung a war club against the grandmother's head, crushing her skull and nose.

Those that could fought back, grabbing their fishing spears, throwing rocks, but their happy lives had made them weak, and despite their greater numbers, all who resisted died. Those who fled or hid were found, and brought back to where the bodies were piled into a mound, carefully arranged. When night fell the crows built a fire, and made strange scratchings in the dirt.

They were given a sweet, foul-tasting drink, like sap and honey mixed with blood. None of them understood the killers' language, except an old falcon, the one who had taught them the trick of preserving food in balls of baked clay. "He is the Crow. His dark wings are the only god. Worship them, learn their power, or die." The young boy, who would absorb more knowledge than any of them and become the Crow himself, was dizzy with the fire and stars. He saw that nothing until now had been real. Wings beat against his face, and his blood both froze and boiled. He vomited, and others around him did the same. Even without the falcon's translations, he felt he understood what the priests were chanting. Killing gave power, and revealed the truth. The sky dried up like a river and he could see the bottom of it, clarified and dark.

"Most of you will die," the falcon said. "Those who live will be crows." Each of the killers took one of the survivors of the glade and put them in pairs, roughly matched in age or size, standing behind them with their clubs. They found a large, sharp stone, and used it to scratch weird lines into the dirt, then leaving it between them. A word was spoken. Either "Continuity," or "Drift."

It started with the oldest. If they didn't pick up the stones, and try to murder their opposite, the war clubs came down on the back of their heads. The high priest walked from pair to pair, saying the word. At first, no one would fight. Then everything seemed to happen at once. Screams of exultation and terror, chanting and drums. He looked at the boy who stood across from him, whose name and face he knew then, like a brother, but which he has since forgotten. The other boy was looking at the stone. In moments, the would-be crow knew, this other would come to this same knowledge, and see the same dark eye, spinning. The boy who became the Crow lunged, grabbing the stone and breaking the other's arm, then knee, finally pounding his skull into the red, exploding dirt.

Drem had vomited in the side of the cave, and Alyoka soon followed. Their eyes, when they came back to the fire, were hollow and unfocused. He had taken their war clubs, and was scratching lines and symbols between where they sat, pounding the ground in time with his droning chant. He could see the darkness fill their eyes, drinking the flame.

"One of you will live, and the other will die, but survive within the victor as strength," he chanted in the old tongue, the language that had been burned into him, that made all other songs and dances boil away. "Both wings fly towards power. We soak the earth, and rise." Then he spoke the word.

The Crow felt the god take flight in him, the freezing heat, wings beating against his face. He set the stone between the warriors. On the wall, behind them, their shadows wavered. One of them reached forward.

It felt good to be moving again, the world rolling under her feet like the clouds over the sky. The first few days had been hard, her father insisting on moving quickly, her legs unused to running. He'd offered to carry her, once, but she'd yelled at him no, she wasn't a little girl.

She was, though. That was what her mother had told the priests when they had come on the solstice to take her. Her mother had cried and wrapped her arms around her, even though other girls, younger than her, had been taken to the cave.

The Crow, the high priest, had come, and told the priests to leave her. They took her brothers instead. Tashe's mother had treated her differently after that, the warmth gone from her voice and eyes.

They said it was the plague, but none of the ones they took were sick. Her mother told her it was for the winter rites, the hunger. Those who were sick or old had to be taken away. Yet there was still enough food, or there would have been, if they'd just waited for her father and the hunters to come back. Nor was it always the old or ill who were taken. Sometimes it was just those the priests didn't like, who had sang too loudly or refused to labor on the mounds.

Her father didn't understand how terrible the winters were, although every year she would cry and tell him. Not just the cold, or the constant drums. The few who returned from the rites were new priests, with their necklaces of bones, which meant more people were taken every year. They killed them. She'd always known the truth, but been afraid to look it in the face. The crows had killed her brothers.

The village was always different after the rites, no one speaking, or meeting one another's eyes. The only songs were a dull dead chant on a single note, the unchanging rhythm of the drums.

Every year, she had begged her father to take her with him on the hunts, not to leave her in the descending cold and dark, but he never would. He hadn't believed her, until now.

Tashe felt like one of the clay globes of food they baked and then broke open, months later. Uncertain what would be inside of her, if she had grown rotten, or bad. She missed her mother, and the other girls, and the patterns on the goat-hide walls she would stare at, finding shapes and faces in the shadows as she fell asleep.

They hadn't had time to grab anything when they ran away that early morning, just a spear, and a few blankets. She hadn't said goodbye to her mother.

At least her father talked to her. His eyes didn't have that lost, always fearful look her mother's had after the winter rites. He answered every question she asked, and pointed out different plants, and animals she wouldn't have noticed, telling her their names, sometimes even in different languages. He gave them silly voices, and made her laugh. At night, he would tell her long, looping stories, and although he denied it, she could tell he was making them up as he went along, adding in details about things they'd done or seen.

Even better, he listened to her songs, the ones no one ever let her sing, with the loud, wavery high notes, and after a while he would sing with her, his deep voice finding a pattern that fit with hers. He would keep humming, softly, after she had stopped and was drifting off to sleep. She could imagine words in his humming, like she had seen faces in the goat skins.

"It's so beautiful here, Papa," she said to him, walking through a forest with trees too big to throw her arms around. "Why wasn't it like this back at the village?"

"People aren't meant to live in one place for so long," he answered. "We cut down the trees to keep us warm, and harvest all the plants, and when we try to grow them, the soil goes bad and blows away. The waters get full with our own waste. A valley or a forest needs to sleep, and rest, without humans crawling on its skin. Look around. No animal stays where it is for more than a season."

"Trees do," she said, and her father nodded, thoughtful.

Tashe lost count of how many days, or months, they traveled. Her limbs grew wiry, and dark, her hair long and matted. At night they set traps, and in the morning sometimes ate raccoons for breakfast. The forest seemed to go on forever, but the trees were even larger, now, and farther apart.

"Another tribe lives here, or passes through," her father said.

"How can you tell?"

"This kind of forest needs burning. And some of these streams must have been dug, or redirected." He pulled a fruit, chalky yellow, from overhead. "There are too many things to eat here for them not to have been planted. It's a garden, like the ones in the valley, only very large, and tended collectively by a tribe, or many of them, as they travel." They had, Tashe realized, been seeing far more elk and deer.

"You know how we sing at night, how you start one of your melodies and I find a part to go with it, so the sounds blend together?" Tashe nodded. It was one of her favorite things in the world, even better than a mash of mint and berries. Her father's voice made her own sound clearer, more powerful, like her lungs were as large as his. "It's like that. The earth is singing. The people here, they've listened, and added their own song. Look carefully. You can hear all the people that have walked here, planted. They have burned and hunted, dug and watered. You can even hear people from long ago. Their ghosts are in the trees." She was quiet and listened, but all she heard were birds.

"Trees do move," he said after a while, reminding her of what she'd said before. "Only very slowly. There is a giant turtle, underground, that carries them on its back." Tashe laughed and said it wasn't true. How would the turtle breathe? "With it's nose," he said, tilting back his head and sticking his own up into the air to show her, "like this..."

There were turtles in the river they were following, and they did stick their noses up, just like that, always ready to duck back under the reflections. She loved the water, and how clean she felt after bathing in it, even if it was cold. Her father tried, but seldom managed, to spear fish. Secretly, she was glad they got away. One day, on the far bank, they saw an animal she'd never seen before, an ungulate with huge, hoary shoulders, and a long face, and horns. They followed it out into a grassy plain, enormous and impossibly bright. They broke off some of the larger branches from the sweetest tasting trees, uncertain when they would see them again, tying them to their backs.

The grass and wildflowers were so high she couldn't see over them, so her father lifted her onto her shoulders. "Papa, look!" She pointed over a green and golden swell of land, over the waving, flowing prairie, to where a herd of the strange animals were snuffling through the grasses, calves gamboling and jumping, adults sniffing the air with huge, flaring nostrils.

Tashe became aware of other, closer, movement. By the tensing of his shoulders, she knew her father had noticed, too.

A human figure came out of the tall grass. A boy, not much older than her. Tashe's father set her down, trying to get her to go behind him, but she stepped forward, instead. The boy was odd looking, with whorls of mud or paint across his chest, but she wasn't afraid. More people came out of the grass, men and women, some wearing clothes that matched the beasts that they had seen. Some carried spears, but pointed towards the sky.

She greeted them, boldly, singing the words instead of saying them, using the old, formal phrases her father had taught. One of the hunters smiled, and stepped forward, putting a hand on the shoulder of the wild-looking boy. "What clan?" he asked.

"Turtle," her father answered. "We have traveled far, but slowly."

"We have trees on our back," Tashe said, and it was true, the branches they'd torn off sticking up crookedly from their packs.

The man held out his hand. "Welcome," he said. "We are Heron."
