LOST

I'm dog-sitting at the Dancing Rabbit Ecovillage, for the next six weeks or so, as long as I'll be writing this. A couple days ago, I followed the mowed paths out through the back fields, land in a federal conservation program, recently burned, with cedars and locusts. The sky was overcast, which, when I told someone the next day about getting lost, was offered as an excuse for why it would have been hard to keep my bearings.

The truth, though, as those who know me well can verify, is that I have always had an abysmal sense of direction. In college, once, when I was driving with some friends, and asked, a few blocks from campus, if I should turn left or right, they thought that I was joking. When I took the wrong turn, they admired my commitment to the joke. It was only after I'd gone a mile or so away from our dorms that they realized no, I seriously had no idea where I was going.

It's better when I'm on foot, but still, especially if I'm with anyone else, I have to consciously force myself to observe my surroundings, and consciously activate whatever part of the brain other people automatically use for orientation.

When I was in Romania, in the Peace Corps, I wrote about how getting lost was really the only way I could force myself to pay attention, to really see any of the things around me. The visceral, animalistic instinct of self-preservation that lights up from a panicked sense of potential disaster is the surest way to jump-start true observation of your environment. Your mind is always taking short-cuts in its perception of the world, filtering out anything not relevant to survival, and noticing landmarks is only proscribed by an evolved psychology when the threat of becoming dangerously lost is looming. So I would wander those neighborhoods in Ploiest, and Bucharest, past those backyards with dogs and clotheslines, and almost getting lost in those cities felt like a metaphor for how I had hoped to really be able to notice the features and landmarks of my life, flirting with disorientation, with being lost, in a greater sense.

I did get lost, I suppose. In that larger sense, I'm not sure I ever found my way back.

The path, at Dancing Rabbit, the "long loop" as I'd heard it called, went by an old windmill, rusting and strangled by grape vines, through muddy draws and fields of leafless trees, under a cold sky of uniform clouds. The mistake I made, coming back, was thinking I could take a different path than the one that brought me there, sure that I knew how to keep the river on my left, that eventually the footpath, growing increasingly indistinct, would cross a larger trail that I remembered.

I got turned around, and doubted my phone when it told me I was wrong.

Here is, maybe, the main impetus behind the story I want to write in the next six weeks: there's a part of the novel Ishmael where the author, or the gorilla who narrates the story, talks about the original sin of civilization being the turn to agriculture. Mesopatamia, the Fertile Crescent, the forked tongue of the Nile.

Humans got tired of moving, of taking the Earth on its own terms, of chasing after whatever grubs and nuts and critters they could find along an always moving way. They stopped. Planted, and tended crops. Claimed land as their own. Maybe invented, for the first time in the planet's long dreaming of itself, the idea that anything could be owned, rather than simply found, and accepted.

Everything came from that. Killing to defend what you saw as the product of your labor, and that of the soil. Surplus, which meant division of labor, which meant caste systems and priesthoods and storage and sewage and shelter and cities rather than nomadic tribes.

Our hero, Wulf, is old enough, and the settlement where he has settled is young enough, that he remembers how things were before. His children have died, and his mate has left for another's bed. He doubts the words of the local priest, and wonders if all these rules, these meetings, these obeisances and taxes are really the way he wants to live. So he wanders, going a little farther every time, hoping to activate that part of his mind that he remembers, when survival depended on close observation of landmarks, of knowing where you were. He only feels alive when uncertain of his ability to return.

And one day, when the sky is overcast and cold, he goes too far, and is lost.
