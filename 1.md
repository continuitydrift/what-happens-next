# The Village

Everything had changed.

They'd come back from the long hunt with skins and salted meat, stories of near drowning, of scaling uncertain cliffs for eggs, Torgun with a scar across his ribs from the tusk of a cornered boar, yet there had been no wild dances to celebrate their return. The village feasted in grim silence, unspiced by joy or laughter, as if in their absence the hunters' friends had been ground down like the grain they'd harvested, a dull paste of flour fried in low, simmering heat of lifeless ceremony.

A sickness had swept the village, rashes of purple spots and coughed up blood, the tribe-mother dead, along with Wulf's two sons.

His wife and daughter now lived with the Crow, who had made new laws, new songs and shuffling dances to win back the favor of a god he called the Phantom, who must be worshipped above all else. His home, once at the center of the village, was now surrounded by the smells of goats penned into muddy fields, uncovered latrines, butchers blocks, and tanning beds. The village, now doubled almost in size after another tribe had settled in the valley, seemed to Wulf themselves like goats, bleating stupidly behind fences when they should be scampering free on piney slopes. Waiting to be slaughtered. There had been rituals, his cousins told him. People burned alive in wicker cages. Blood poured on the ring of stones.

The old ways were still there, the warp and weft of woven baskets, the traps for birds and nets for flashing fish, but all recast, as in a troubled dream, into a dull, pervasive madness, that failed to dissipate even with the coming spring. Thunderstoms broke open the jar of the sky, but the pouring rains only soaked in the curse, like blood left to stain a hide. Even his close band of hunters stopped coming to his fires, following Torgun to the temple meals outside the new granary, under the blessings of the Crows. The meat they'd carried back over plains and fields of ice grew maggoty and rancid on the poles. Power had shifted. The villagers worked long days stacking mud-bricks and stones ported from plowed-up earth high onto the temple mound, and followed the new laws for planting.

Wulf didn't, and was visited by the Crow.

"Your garden isn't blessed," the high priest said, fingering his necklace of bones. Two priests stood by the door with war-clubs, one tall and the other burly. Wulf suddenly felt old, as if this last winter had been ten. His life smelled like the midden heaps outside, thrown out coals and shit compacted by abandoned time, where nothing would be allowed to grow.

"It is as my father planted," Wulf said, proudly. He'd been a boy, with only two feathers on his vest, when they'd come to the valley, and had found the Crows scratching in the field. They'd never seen people *growing* food before. They had always ever moved, searching, following the game and fires and seasons, gathering what they could find. "This," the Crows had told them, "could be your home."

There was a jar, finely painted, that Wulf's mother had carried on her back when he, an infant, was swaddled on her front. Every day he filled it with water from the stream, and set it on the hearth. It showed six herons, gliding around the banded swell of well-baked clay, across the infinite earthen sky. The Crow knocked it over. Water soaked the straw.

Wulf left that day, taking his spear and weighted net. He meant to come back. The village was his world, and he could no more leave it than a bird could forever leave the Earth.

He had been walking, as the weather warmed, farther and farther in the mountains, as was his right as an elder, although the priests had scowled and muttered, watching others stack stones in meaningless mounds. He always made it back by night. This day, the sky was grey with unmoving clouds, his mind heavy with cold, dark thoughts, and his feet took him into the mountain paths away from routes where they went to gather berries or collect the bowls of sap, through the ancient pines, along hidden, uncertain ridges, beyond springs and surprising flushes of new flowers. He took a way he'd never gone before, following a ghost of half-remembered youth. The gut-colored sky made it hard to be sure of direction, or of time.

His distracted brooding melted into fear, with the yipping laughter of a fox. He'd thought he was retracing his steps, taking an unfamiliar path he was sure would intersect with those he knew, but now he'd lost the scent, and here was a grove of twisted poplars, unfamiliar. The profile of the mountains was a stranger's face, with a broken nose.

He was lost.
